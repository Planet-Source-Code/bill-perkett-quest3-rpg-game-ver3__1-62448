******To making a game:***** 
To make a game you
1) Create a map
2) Add thought (this can show additional clues and controls when a person can talk)
3) Add speech (this is used to tell the item location and what the people say)
4) In the speech you can define a quest, request an item, or give an item 

The speech file has the x and y location of each person,sign, house, and star gate.
For a person or sign you need the x and y location and the persons name
For a house or star gate you need the x and y location and the new map name
You also need the Newx and Newy location of where you will start on the new map
